## Thanks for visiting! ##
I am Katsuhisa Kawaguchi (川口雄久), currently working in a Japanese web company. I did my PhD in the field of system neuroscience in Tübingen, Germany. I have been interested in the information processing of the brain that translates sensory information into a meaningful behavior.

Currently I am a data scientist / software engineer in a Japanese company. I am a Kaggle expert and excited about using machine learning techniques to understand our world better.

I spend my spare time on Japanese subcultures or table tennis :)
