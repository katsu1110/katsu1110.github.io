## Thanks for visiting! ##
I am Katsuhisa Kawaguchi, a PhD student in system neuroscience, Tübingen, Germany. I have been interested in the information processing of the brain to translate sensory information into a meaningful behavior.

I spend my spare time on Japanese subcultures or table tennis :)
