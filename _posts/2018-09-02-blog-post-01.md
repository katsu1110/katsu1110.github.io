## Github pages, Jekyll ##
Building my personal website had not been my intention for a long time. However, the other day, when I put my name on the Google search just for fun, I found a number of information about me which was totally old. I thought, ok, it may be nicer to build a website about the up-to-date information about me which I am happy to share with and put it on top of all the other websites.

I know that many people use wordpress or wix. However, Github pages with Jekyll especially with [template for academic pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) is an easy way to achieve it for those who have a Github account already.
